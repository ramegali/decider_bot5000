# DECIDER BOT 5000

### FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS
Had enough of friends who can't decide where to eat? Tired of the same old? How about the girlfriend/boyfriend who's "down for whatever"?

We've all been there. But life does *not* have to be so annoying.
Introducing **DECIDER BOT 5000**, putting a decisive end to indecisiveness!

### SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT
- Picks a random cuisine for you to eat (like a food genre)
- After getting your location and price range, Decider Bot will use the ```Yelp Fusion``` API to find places near you that serve said cuisine
- Once that's done, you can view the results before Decider Bot picks one of them at random

And VOILA you now have a place to go!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You cannot use this code without an access token for the Yelp Fusion API. You can click [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started) to get started!

### AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION
- **Create user accounts** 
	*for example:* Like the place? Save it, and then you can randomly pick a place from your favorites.
- Give user option for picking cuisine? Maybe the user is already in the mood for something, but just needs to find a random place nearby that serves it.
- Possible ideas for different decisions to be made: movies, what to
  cook (recipes) 

### KNOWN BUGS
- [x] ~~Error getting prices for some locales causing it to crash on display.~~ Added try block.
- [ ] Nothing in place to catch invalid zipcodes or price parameters.

**DISCLAIMER:** Not responsible for bad or otherwise unsatisfactory dining experiences. Follow Decider Bot's sage advice at your own discretion.
