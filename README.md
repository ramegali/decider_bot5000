# DECIDER BOT 5000

## FEATURES:
**Decider Bot** is designed to randomly pick a food for you to eat, then
list all available options near you using the ```Yelp Fusion``` API.
It will then be possible to randomly pick from those available options as well.


### AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION:
- **Create user accounts** 
	*for example:* Like the place? Save it, and then you can randomly pick a place from your favorites.
- Give user option for picking cuisine? Maybe the user is already in the mood for something, but just needs to find a random place nearby that serves it.
- Possible ideas for different decisions to be made: movies, what to
  cook (recipes) 

### Known bugs
- [ ] Error getting prices for some locales causing it to crash on display. Should implement test case for this.
